## Abstract

This repository contains the results of my attempts to learn the Go programming
language (a.k.a. golang) by implementing some non-trivial and possible useful
packages.

My systems programming language of choice has changed over the decades,
depending on what I was getting paid to do. In the 1970s, it was IBM 360/370
Basic Assembler Language (BAL), and later a language implemented in BAL macro
language. In the 1980s it was PDP-11 Assembler Language (PAL). In the late
1980s and to the mid 1990s it was C. In the mid-1990s to the 2000s it was C++,
which was mostly an artifact of the long history Bell Labs and its spinoffs had
for using C++ for firmware development. In the 2010s, I saw a serious reduction
in the use of C++ for systems programming, in part due to the evolution of C++
into a langauge that was hard to learn, hard to debug, and not terribly
productive to use. During all this time I cast about for an alternative to C++
and C. I briefly considered D, but it didn't seem to catch on with the
mainstream. When Google began promoting Go, it seemed like a resonable thing
to try out (although it took me a while).
